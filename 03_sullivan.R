# refer to lifetables calculated in 01 and prevalence in 02

# 1 notice that prevalence is in 2-year age groups,
# but lifetables are in single years.
# to join on age, you need like age groups
# either you gradaute prevalence (possibly smoothing at same time),
# or you group lifetables to 2-year age groups. What'll it be


# 1.1 smooth/graduate prevalence

# 1.2 group lifetables to 2-year age groups (just need Lx, but sure to make lt start at 50!)

# 2 join prev and lifetable (either single or 2-yr ages)
