# 1 read in counts.csv.gz usig read_csv()

# 2 calculate denominators by summing transitions
# originating from a state and age (these are exhaustive)

# 3 calculate transitions

# 4 make some exploratory plots, try to understand what the
# transitions mean. These could be noisy, so maybe geom_point() + geom_smooth() would help.

# 5 if you wanted to calculate interesting ratios,
# like UD / HD, then you'd probably want smoothed or modeled
# probabilities
