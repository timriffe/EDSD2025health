# 1 read in data/prev.czv.gz using read_csv()

# 2 reshape so that states H and U are side-by-side, with values n
# use pivot_wider() for this

# 3 calculate prev as U / (U + H) using mutate()

# 4 make some plots of prevalence, and some observations
# would you maybe want to smooth this?
# any odd features?

# 5 make one or more plots of sex ratios in prevalence
# what can be said about these?
